            <p>This is a Visualization of the Centipede Game in Game Theory. There are two players switching turns and
                by
                continuing they increase the payoff but also the chance the other player quits for getting a better
                payoff. The name "Centipede" comes from the graph you can draw for the possible payoffs of each player.
            </p>
            <p>Based on Backwards Induction the best play for the first player is to quit on the first round, if they
                expects, the game won't continue till the end.</p>

            <h4>II. Introduction</h4>
            <p>The (N-turn) Centipede Game is an <strong>extensive form game</strong> with two players. In the first
                turn of the game,
                Player 1 and Player 2 are presented with a sum of money $. Player 1 can either choose to take, and get
                more money than Player 2, or pass. If Player 1 takes the money the game is over. If Player 1 passes, the
                sum of money is altered and now Player 2 can decide to take or pass on it. If Player 2 takes, they get
                more money than Player 1 and the game ends. If Player 2 passes, again the sum of money is altered, and
                now the second turn of the game starts. This process repeats until one of the players decides to take
                the money, or until the game runs out of N turns. If each player passes for every turn in the game, both
                players leave with an equal amount of money.</p>
            <h4>III. Important Concept</h4>
            <p>Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is a refinement to the concept of a Nash equilibrium (see: <a
                    href="https://hammerhead-app-yndie.ondigitalocean.app/">The prisoner's
                    dilemma game</a>). First, any <em>subgame perfect</em> Nash equilibrium of a game is also a
                <strong>Nash equilibrium</strong> of that
                game. Second, subgame perfect Nash equilibria captures the idea of “perfect recall” where players
                “remember” their past action choices as they progress through the game and use their “memories” to play
                “better” as the game progresses. That is, in a SPNE, players act like they would act in hindsight.

            <h3>Let's Play!</h3>
            <p>On the following page two persons or one person and a computer can play the game. Player 1 can choose
                first if to continue or end the
                game, than it's player 2's turn. It continues till one of the players is ending the game or the last
                round is reached. The graph shows the possible payoffs for each player and the current state of the
                game.</p>

                Graph with 2 human players. The third buttons lets you play against a computer player.</p>
