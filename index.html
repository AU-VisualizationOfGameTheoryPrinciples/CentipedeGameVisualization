            <p>This is a Visualization of the Centipede Game in Game Theory. There are two players switching turns and
                by
                continuing they increase the payoff but also the chance the other player quits for getting a better
                payoff. The name "Centipede" comes from the graph you can draw for the possible payoffs of each player.
            </p>
            <p>Based on Backwards Induction the best play for the first player is to quit on the first round, if they
                expects, the game won't continue till the end.</p>
            <p>On the following page two persons can play the game. Player 1 can choose first if to continue or end the
                game, than it's player 2's turn. It continues till one of the players is ending the game or the last
                round is reached. The graph shows the possible payoffs for each player and the current state of the game.</p>
